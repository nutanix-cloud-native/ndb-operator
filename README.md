# Nutanix Database Service Operator for Kubernetes
The NDB operator brings automated and simplified database administration, provisioning, and life-cycle management to Kubernetes.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against, which should have network connectivity to the NDB installation. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Installation and Running on the cluster
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`      
<br>
### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make generate manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)

### Using the Operator
1. To create instances of custom resources (provision databases), edit [ndb_v1alpha1_database.yaml](config/samples/ndb_v1alpha1_database.yaml) file with the NDB installation and database instance details and run:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/ndb_v1alpha1_database.yaml
```
2. To delete instances of custom resources (deprovision databases) run:

```sh
kubectl delete -f config/samples/ndb_v1alpha1_database.yaml
```

### Building and pushing to an image registry  
Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/ndb-operator:tag
```

<br>

### Deploy the operator pushed to an image registry  
Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/ndb-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster
