## Installation / Deployment
### Pre-requisites
1. Access to an NDB Server.
2. A Kubernetes cluster to run against, which should have network connectivity to the NDB server. The operator will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).
3. The [operator-sdk installed](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/).
4. A clone of the source code ([this](https://github.com/nutanix-cloud-native/ndb-operator) repository).
5. Cert-manager (only when running in non OpenShift clusters). Follow the instructions [here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/).

With the pre-requisites completed, the NDB Operator can be deployed in one of the following ways: 

### Outside Kubernetes
Runs the controller outside the Kubernetes cluster as a process, but installs the CRDs, services and RBAC entities within the Kubernetes cluster. Generally used while development (without running webhooks):
```sh
make install run
```

### Within Kubernetes 
Runs the controller pod, installs the CRDs, services and RBAC entities within the Kubernetes cluster. Used to run the operator from the container image defined in the Makefile. Make sure that the cert-manager is installed if not using OpenShift.

```sh
make deploy
```

### Using Helm Charts
The Helm charts for the NDB Operator project are available on artifacthub.io and can be installed by following the instructions [here](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/nutanix/ndb-operator?modal=install).

### On OpenShift
To deploy the operator from this repository on an OpenShift cluster, create a bundle and then install the operator via the operator-sdk.
```sh
# Export these environment variables to overwrite the variables set in the Makefile
export DOCKER_USERNAME=dockerhub-username
export VERSION=x.y.z
export IMG=docker.io/$DOCKER_USERNAME/ndb-operator:v$VERSION
export BUNDLE_IMG=docker.io/$DOCKER_USERNAME/ndb-operator-bundle:v$VERSION

# Build and push the container image to the container registry
make docker-build docker-push

# Build the bundle following the prompts for input, build and push the bundle image to the container registry
make bundle bundle-build bundle-push

# Install the operator (run on the OpenShift cluster)
operator-sdk run bundle $BUNDLE_IMG

NOTE: 
The container and bundle image creation steps can be skipped if existing images are present in the container registry.
```

## Usage
###  Create secrets to be used by the NDBServer and Database resources using the manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: ndb-secret-name
type: Opaque
stringData:
  username: username-for-ndb-server
  password: password-for-ndb-server
  ca_certificate: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    CA CERTIFICATE (ca_certificate is optional)
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: db-instance-secret-name
type: Opaque
stringData:
  password: password-for-the-database-instance
  ssh_public_key: SSH-PUBLIC-KEY

```

Create the secrets:

```
kubectl apply -f <path/to/secrets-manifest.yaml>
```

###  Create the NDBServer resource. The manifest for NDBServer is described as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: ndb.nutanix.com/v1alpha1
kind: NDBServer
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: ndbserver
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: ndbserver
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: ndb-operator
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kustomize
    app.kubernetes.io/created-by: ndb-operator
  name: ndb
spec:
    # Name of the secret that holds the credentials for NDB: username, password and ca_certificate created earlier
    credentialSecret: ndb-secret-name
    # NDB Server's API URL
    server: https://[NDB IP]:8443/era/v0.9
    # Set to true to skip SSL certificate validation, should be false if ca_certificate is provided in the credential secret.
    skipCertificateVerification: true

```
Create the NDBServer resource using:
```sh
kubectl apply -f <path/to/NDBServer-manifest.yaml>
```

### Create a Database Resource. A database can either be provisioned or cloned on NDB based on the inputs specified in the database manifest.

#### Provisioning manifest

```sh
kubectl delete -f <path/to/database-manifest.yaml>
```

### Deleting the NDBServer resource
To deregister the database and delete the VM run:
```sh
kubectl delete -f <path/to/NDBServer-manifest.yaml>
```

## Developement

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make generate manifests
```
Add the CRDs to the Kubernetes cluster
```sh
make install
```
Run your controller locally (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTES:** 
1. You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`
2. Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)

### Building and pushing to an image registry
Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/ndb-operator:tag
```

### Deploy the operator pushed to an image registry
Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/ndb-operator:tag
```
---
## Uninstallation / Cleanup
Uninstall the operator based on the installation/deployment  environment

### Running outside the cluster
```sh
# Stops the controller process
ctrl + c
# Uninstalls the CRDs
make uninstall
```

### Running inside the cluster
```sh
# Removes the deployment, crds, services and rbac entities
make undeploy
```

### Running using Helm charts
```sh
# NAME: name of the release created during installation
helm uninstall NAME
```

### Running on Openshift
```sh
operator-sdk cleanup ndb-operator --delete-all
```

## How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/). It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

A custom resource of the kind Database is created by the reconciler, followed by a Service and an Endpoint that maps to the IP address of the database instance provisioned. Application pods/deployments can use this service to interact with the databases provisioned on NDB through the native Kubernetes service.

Pods can specify an initContainer to wait for the service (and hence the database instance) to get created before they start up.
```yaml
  initContainers:
  - name: init-db
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', "until nslookup <<Database CR Name>>-svc.$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/namespace).svc.cluster.local; do echo waiting for database service; sleep 2; done"]
```
